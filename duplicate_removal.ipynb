      "\n",
      "From year to year, we see new and innovative attacks as well as variations on tried-\n",
      "and-true attacks that still remain successful\n",
      " From the exploitation of well-known \n",
      "and far-reaching zero-day vulnerabilities, such as the one that affected MOVEit, to \n",
      "the much more mundane but still incredibly effective Ransomware and Denial of \n",
      "Service (DoS) attacks, criminals continue to do their utmost to prove the old adage \n",

      "\n",
      "The shifting landscape of cyber threats can be confusing and overwhelming\n",
      " When, \n",
      "in addition to the attack types mentioned above, one throws in factors such as the \n",
      "human element and/or poorly protected passwords, things become even more \n",
      "confused\n",
      " One might be forgiven for viewing the current state of cybersecurity \n",

      "isn’t necessarily pretty\n",
      " The past year has been a busy one for cybercrime\n",
      " We \n",
